# Passenger satisfaction
Logistic Regression Classifier - Machine Learning Project 

For a project focused on classifying the binary variable "Satisfaction," I used Logistic Regression. After preprocessing the dataset, I established a model that exhibited strong performance scores: 
- accuracy score of 0.875
- precision score of 0.866
- recall score of 0.843
- F1 score of 0.854
- ROC AUC score of 0.871

These results demonstrate the model's high effectiveness in predicting customer satisfaction
